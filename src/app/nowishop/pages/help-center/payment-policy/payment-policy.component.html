          We realize the importance of strong fraud detection and having a system for resolving
these issues. Nowishop and our online payment partners are consistently monitoring
transactions for suspicious activity in order to flag potentially fraudulent transactions
for manual verification.
In the rarest of cases, when our team is unable to rule out the possibility of fraud
categorically, the transaction is kept on hold, and the customer is requested to
provide identification documents. These ID documents help us ensure that the
purchases were made by the genuine card holder.
In this matter we want to thank our customers for their patience with any
inconvenience that may be caused to them and encourage them to bear with us in the
interest of ensuring a safe and secure online transaction environment.
